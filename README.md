# pretty-easi
A QIIME 2 plugin to expose some [SpiecEasi](https://github.com/zdk123/SpiecEasi) functionality and make plotting networks easier.

## install
pretty-easi is still pre-pre-beta, but if you want to install it, here are the steps:

1. Install QIIME2 using conda (instructions here https://docs.qiime2.org/2022.8/install/native/).
2. Activate your QIIME2 conda env.
3. Install r-spieceasi into that env (`install -c conda-forge -c bioconda r-spieceasi` worked for me).
4. Clone pretty-easy into a local directory.
5. cd into that directory and run `pip install .`.
